# NodeJS and NPM

ReactJS requires you to have NodeJS and NPM (node package manager) installed. NodeJS allows the javascript files to be run in your development environment, and NPM allows you to install/manage packages that the app requires to run.
  - NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
  - NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm

# Installing packages 

Once you've installed NodeJS and NPM (and cloned this repo), you can go into the frontend and backend files to install the package dependencies.

To get the server running:

```sh
$ cd sh-2019-fullstack-example
$ cd backend
$ npm install
$ node server.js
```

To get the frontend ReactJS app running:

```sh
$ cd sh-2019-fullstack-example
$ cd frontend
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then, go to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser and you should see the app running!
